# Attractor_Based_Memory_Plaussibility_Study

This is the repository for the paper *"Can the Insect Path Integration Memory be a Bump Attractor"*?

This directory contains two subdirectories:

`Bump_Attractor_Simulations`
and
`Path_Integration_Simulations`

`Bump_Attractor_Simulations` contains the code for running, analysing, and plotting the bump attractor simulations. 

`Path_Integration_Simulations` contains the code for running, analysing, and plotting the agent simulations. 

Please, see the `REAMDME.md` files in these directories for details on how to use the respective code.
