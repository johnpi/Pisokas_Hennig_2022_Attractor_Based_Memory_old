It seems while moving the file collected_drift_trials_all_EC_LV_reduced_2_duration300s_noise2.3Hz_veddie02_1024.npy to Done/ a new version of the file was written again slightly larger (1233913256 Dec  8 17:09 collected_drift_trials_all_EC_LV_reduced_2_duration300s_noise2.3Hz_veddie02_1024.npy). I have kept both until I see what is happening.
